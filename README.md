Python library for WALS


Requirements
------------

- urllib3
- matplotlib (if plotting is needed)


Still TODO
----------

- Double check WALs data, I think they're inconsistent in the order they specify latitude and longitude.
- For the plotting, use a different projection. Currently the data points do not stretch to the poles properly.
